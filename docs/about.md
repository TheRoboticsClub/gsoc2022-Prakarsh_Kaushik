Prakarsh is currently a senior at Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College, pursuing Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering as his major. His research interests include Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Autonomous Systems, and Embodied AI.

He's broadly interested in the intersection of robotics and artificial intelligence. Or to be more accurate, he wants to build robotic systems that can learn to perform tasks and make intelligent sequences of decisions through their experience of interacting with their unstructured and dynamic environment with minimal supervision.
