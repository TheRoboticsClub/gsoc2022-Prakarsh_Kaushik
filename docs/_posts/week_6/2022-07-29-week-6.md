# **Week 6**

> * In the previous week we discussed the PR with rotors_driver changes and the merging status of the prototype of current exercise.The PR & issue are in this [post](https://theroboticsclub.github.io/gsoc2022-Prakarsh_Kaushik/2022/07/15/week-5.html) and the updates in this week's post.* 

## **How did I contributed in this week?**

**The error regarding the spawning position of drone cat and mouse exercise was solved and cv2 import error didn't occur. I began with the multiprocessing part for the drones based exercise**


- **One exercise prototype code with Multiprocessing's use is almost done. The changes will be updated on this [PR](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/pull/1772)**
