description: Testing out rotorS simulation run on ros-noetic

# **Week 1**

> *After discussing with the mentors and fixing the tentative timeline, I started working on the build error in this [post](https://theroboticsclub.github.io/gsoc2022-Prakarsh_Kaushik/2022/06/10/community-bonding.html).* 

## **How did I contributed in this week?**

The vey first thing was solving the rotorS build error. It was solved through fixing dependencies issue of mavlink and mavcomm package. After getting the rotorS simulator package built from the following github [repo](https://github.com/ntnu-arl/rotors_simulator/tree/dev/arl_planners_gazebo9) for ros-noetic. I tried testing it out on my system. But after running the following launch file through:
```
roslaunch rotors_gazebo mav_hovering_example.launch mav_name:=firefly world_name:=basic
```
I faced another issue at the door:

To solve this issue, I looked into various forums and repos and found a possible replacement or an extension for the rotorS in the form of [CrazyS](https://github.com/gsilano/CrazyS).
CrazyS is an extension of the ROS package RotorS, aimed to modeling, developing and integrating the Crazyflie 2.0 nano-quadcopter in the physics based simulation environment Gazebo. 

Building the ros-noetic packages available in this repos for rotorS solved the issue and we have a clear path. Here's the drone hovering with rotorS sim:
