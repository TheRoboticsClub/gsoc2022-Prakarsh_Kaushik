description: Testing out rotorS simulation run on ros-noetic

# **Week 1**

> *After discussing with the mentors and fixing the tentative timeline, I started working on the build error in this [post](https://theroboticsclub.github.io/gsoc2022-Prakarsh_Kaushik/2022/06/10/community-bonding.html).* 

## **How did I contributed in this week?**

The vey first thing was solving the rotorS build error. It was solved through fixing dependencies issue of mavlink and mavcomm package. After getting the rotorS simulator package built from the following github [repo](https://github.com/ntnu-arl/rotors_simulator/tree/dev/arl_planners_gazebo9) for ros-noetic. I tried testing it out on my system. But after running the following launch file through:
```
roslaunch rotors_gazebo mav_hovering_example.launch mav_name:=firefly world_name:=basic
```
I faced another issue at the door:
