# **Week 11**

> * Previously and even now health issues are there due to food poisoning but the show has to go on so I had to pull all nighters with this condition to get the work done. The PR & issue are in this [post](https://theroboticsclub.github.io/gsoc2022-Prakarsh_Kaushik/2022/07/15/week-10.html) and the updates in this week's post.* 

## **How did I contributed in this week?**

**The frontend of the decided first three exercises from proposed calendar was completed and pushed.**

- **In the *rescue_people*, random spawing of people was done and a led light model was added with HAL interface:**

**Rescue people with iris in rotors:**
