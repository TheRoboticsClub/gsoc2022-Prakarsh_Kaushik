# **Week 4**

> * In the last week's meeting we discussed with the prototyping results of drone cat and mouse exercise adnnext week goals. The results of prototyping are in this [post](https://theroboticsclub.github.io/gsoc2022-Prakarsh_Kaushik/2022/07/08/week-3.html) and the updates in this week's post.* 

## **How did I contributed in this week?**

**The most suitable exercise for getting a solid go for integrating rotors is drone cat and mouse and rotors performed really well on it as compared to PX4. So, I opened a PR involving changed exercise folders for follow turtlebot and drone cat and mouse ready to be integrated. Also, made a descriptional video for the results and worked with changing drone wrapper as in to integrated rotors**
