description: Providing multiprocessing backend to other exercises and some bugfixes

# **Week 9**

> * Lastly the using of different model, i.e., iris was decided for optimisation and multiprocessing and model change stats were shown in rotors. The PR & issue are in this [post](https://theroboticsclub.github.io/gsoc2022-Prakarsh_Kaushik/2022/07/15/week-8.html) and the updates in this week's post.* 

## **How did I contributed in this week?**

**I spread the multiprocessing backend to the remaining drone based exercises which had their own specific changes in the general template like way of variable sharing and some bugs while implementing.**

- **The PR and issue associated with it is [this](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/pull/1795) which can be referred for all the commits.**

**Bugs and confusions faced with some methods learnt for debugging:**

- **In the beginning I needed the namespace as a parameter for rotors_driver which led to tricky code change but was then later realised that launching nodes in one group will automatically provide the namespace even without providing the rotors_driver node the param.**

- **Usually while running the docker container I wasn't able to see the printed message to tell me where does the code breaks as there were multiple processes being launched from manager.py. Only the messages in the manager were printed. What I found a workaround was try and except block, i.e., to put a statement at the line which you think is breaking the code which for sure will raise an error.**

*The drone model was changed to* **firefly,** *for getting a better size ratio for the drone exercises*

- **Testing out the new drone model with simple control node:**

*The node basically was used to create publisher and subscriber for controlling the position of the drone using* **LeePositionController Node**

- **These two launch files were changed with drone the new drone model and a camera plugin added (follow_turtlebot & drone_cat_and_mouse respectively):**

- **Down below is only changed value.py script from shared folder for position control for variable sharing**
